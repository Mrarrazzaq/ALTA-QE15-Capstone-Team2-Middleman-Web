# Middleman API Automation Testing

## Overview
This project is a Selenium-based web testing framework written in Java. It uses Maven for build automation and dependency management, and Cucumber for writing test scenarios in a readable BDD (Behavior Driven Development) format.
The middleman application is an agent between wholesalers and users (stores) to make transactions and stock recaps faster in the warehouse.
The primary goal of this project is to ensure that the Website is working as expected, validate the
responses, and verify the correctness of the page.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Java 21**: The programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and running tests.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
- **Cucumber for Java**: Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that supports Cucumber, enabling BDD testing with Gherkin syntax.
